         <h2>DeSuung,</h2>
      <p> meaning “Guardians of Peace”, is the brainchild of His Majesty The King to promote the spirit of volunteerism, the positive influence of ethics, and the values of community service, integrity and civic responsibility in society. Since its launch in February 2011, 4,457 DeSuups have been trained in the 37 runs of the DeSuung Integrated Training Program (DeSuung website). As you read this article, close to 2,500 trainees of the 38th batch, mostly teachers, are graduating from seven training centres across the country. They will join fellow DeSuups to supplement the work of existing personnel working in various capacities across the country in combatting Covid-19.

      <h1>Desuung Skilling Program</h1>
     
      <p>It begins with beating the billets, a long and arduous process in refining metal which will be followed by milling, turning, grinding, filing, broaching, and drilling. Stock removal, a process that involves using saws, belt sanders, and abrasives to strip material away from a steel workpiece, is the favoured way to create blade shapes faster.

A few metres away, amid the roaring blare of cutting tools and machines, a group of men are busy carving chotse, intricate design details, on a traditional Bhutanese domestic altar—choeshum. This is their final project that will show how proficient and skilled they are in woodworking.

When the nation was going through a difficult time, thousands of youth joined the de-suung programme to volunteer for critical services such as border patrolling, service delivery, and crowd control, among others. His Majesty the King commanded that for the exceptional services that the de-suups rendered the State should reciprocate by providing opportunities for the youth to enhance their skills and capabilities so that they can participate meaningfully in the process of nation building.</p>
